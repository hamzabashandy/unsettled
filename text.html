        <div class="text abstract_title">Abstract: </div>
        <div class="text abstract_text"><p>Two Sides of a Barricade argues that to construct global democracy, conflict and dissent must be taken seriously. Christian Scholl explores the political significance of the confrontations within four sites of interaction: bodies, space, communication, and law. Each site of struggle provides a different entry point to understand the influence of protester and police tactics on each other. At the same time, the four sites of struggle allow a comprehensive analysis of how the contestation of global hegemonic forces during summit protests trigger a preemptive shift in social control through increased deployment of biopolitical forms of power. <br><br> This chapter explains the evolution of academic tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) barricades for the purpose of preparing fluoropolymers, which to the best of knowledge began a little over 25 years ago with a facility at Clemson University's Hunter Laboratories. It explains initial barricade was primarily for TFE cylinder storage, from which approximately 10 g of TFE was destabilized at a time and used to prepare the initial perfluorosulfonimide polymer electrolytes in the DesMarteau laboratory. One of the most common causes of accidents when working with TFE is opening a valve too rapidly when a high pressure differential exists in the tubing/pipeline on the two sides of the valve. Due to adiabatic compression, localized heating can cause high temperatures to be reached, which can end up triggering an explosion.</p></div>

        <div class="text abstract_text"><p>Imagine a self sustained home, where you donâ€™t pay for electricity or water; a home that
cleans itself and, imagine windows that can control the heat going in and out of the space, and
air conditioning systems that function for free. These features are not a dream any more. Now
that nanoscience is developing in a high speed to benefit humanity and increase the quality of
life on earth; nanomaterials will add a new form of intelligence to our built environment
starting by making our smart home ideas even smarter. Nanotechnology, a science that works
on the molecular scale is set to transform the way we build. Nanotechnology revolution is
bringing dramatic improvements in building performance, energy efficiency, environmental
sensing, and sustainability, leading the way to greener buildings. what nanotechnology can
offer the built environment is a wide range of functions and possibilities, varies between
saving and producing energy to helping with water desalination and water purification, to
reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of devices we use every day at home; that will
render these devices and luxury features feasible and attainable in a fewer cost. In this project
a collaboration between a Nano-scientist, a Mechatronics engineer and an architect is taking
place under the umbrella of Nanotech Research Centre; the first nanotechnology centre in
Egypt and the middle east, to try constructing the next generation of smart homes, choosing a
villa in the Egyptian north shore as a case study for we believe smart design cannot be done
without a thorough consideration of the location. The purpose of NanoSmartHome is to
manifest the way of these advantages are being applied and transformed into a product that we 
- 296 -
live in and has a direct impact in our daily lives. Mainly the target is to make it as
environmentally efficient as possible in Egypt, as well as ultra-low maintenance.
